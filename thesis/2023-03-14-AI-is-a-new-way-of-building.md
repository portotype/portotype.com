# Thesis: AI is a new way of building startups

## The thesis

I think AI will spawn a new way of building applications. 

- the best-in-class AIs (OpenAI) are pre-trained on the whole of open-source and open-solutions (stack overflow, API documentation)
- This means that out of the box, you can ask AI to generate code from it.
- This means that companies will have an incentive to 
    - choose open-source libraries and components / APIs, as its faster to build in them;
    - keep the connection to these as abstracted and pure as possible. 
- This means that companies will also have an incentive to:
    - provide open-source libraries and components / APIs, as its faster to build with them;
    - keep their products open and free to extend.
- This will lead to an explosion of solutions, and a far lower cost in building.
- This will benefit 
    - components that are easy to use an integrate (APIs) with few complexities (rate limiting)
    - companies that are a free canvas where you can add all these building blocks   

## Key benefit

- faster code development
- infinite extensibility 
- user-generated "code" or "configs" in a markdown matter with simple syntaxes.
