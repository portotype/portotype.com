### How I invest

I invest mostly in topics close to my interests: software that helps its users be the hero; generally that means work and productivity software, and in particular the more technically powerful the software, the more I like it. Exceptions to this are startups of people in my direct network who I know well, including some local heroes in Porto (PT) and the Berlin (DE) ecosystems. 

Technically, I hold stock in startups via investments and agreements, sometimes both. 
- Investments are situations where I directly invested money. I give cash, I get shares. I usually put in $10k, with a few rare exceptions.
- Agreements are situations where I get shares or the economic benefit of shares because of my involvement.
    - Scouting agreements reward me for helping a VC find good investments. I don't actually sign the investment or send them money. Instead, I propose interesting companies and VCs invest. I may get a return if the company is successful. In my Portfolio, "Accel Starters" is a scouting program from Accel.com with amounts typically $20-30k. "Shilling Scouting" is the scouting program from Shilling.vc, where I do a recommendation for investment, and get a benefit if the company does well. 
    - Advisor agreements are those that reward me with shares for helping a company or being a Board Member; conditions apply to these shares, including vesting, and I can be "let go" of the agreement. It depends a lot, but I've seen advisors get 0.05%-0.4% depending on when they join.
- "Personal investments" are executed via my micro investment company (Portotype), but in the past I held the investments personally.

### Other investments

- Domains. I buy a few [.com domains](../domains/) for my projects, occasionally sell them too. 
- Tech news. I collect newspapers and print publications regarding big technology moments.
- Memes. I collect comic prints, mostly printed, signed and/or numbered memes. They are an inspiration and a reminder of the power of internet communication and art on the internet.
