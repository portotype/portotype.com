### How I invest

I want to invest in software and hard that helps users be the hero.

Technically, I hold stock in startups via investments and agreements, sometimes both. 
- Investments are situations where I directly invested money. I give $5k-$30k cash, I get shares.
- Scouting rewards me for helping a VC make good investments. I have advised for Accel Starters, Shilling Scouting and Invictus Capital.
- Being an Advisor rewards me with shares for being a Board Member or help in other forms, likely on top of a role or investment.

### Other investments

- Domains. I buy a few [.com domains](../domains/) for my projects, occasionally sell them too. 
- Memes and print News. I collect comic prints, mostly printed, signed and/or numbered memes. They are an inspiration and a reminder of the power of internet communication and art on the internet. I collect newspapers and print publications regarding big technology moments.
