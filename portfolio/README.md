### How I invest

I invest mostly in topics close to my interests: software that helps its users be the hero; generally that means work and productivity software, and in particular the more technically powerful the software, the more I like it. 

Technically, I hold stock in startups via investments and agreements, sometimes both. 
- Investments are situations where I directly invested money. I give cash, I get shares. I usually put in $5-30k.
- Scouting rewards me for helping a VC make good investments. In my Portfolio "Accel Starters" and "Shilling Scouting". Being an Advisor rewards me with shares for being a Board Member or help in other forms, likely on top of a role or investment.

### Other investments

- Domains. I buy a few [.com domains](../domains/) for my projects, occasionally sell them too. 
- Memes and print News. I collect comic prints, mostly printed, signed and/or numbered memes. They are an inspiration and a reminder of the power of internet communication and art on the internet. I collect newspapers and print publications regarding big technology moments.
