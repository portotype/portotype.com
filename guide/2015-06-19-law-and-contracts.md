# Law and contracts

1. For most contracts, the business standard is enough. If you're getting a Term Sheet that is exactly like YC, it's fine. Don't try to overly optimize.
2. For many details of a contract, gettting the opinion of an expert founder is enough; get a lawyer to review it.
3. Understand when lawyers will step in. Too early, and its a mess; too late and you're sorry.
