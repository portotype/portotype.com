# Leading from the bottom of the org chart

HR-wise, the place of a great leader is at the bottom of an org-chart. A corner stone on top of which a team can be built.

A great leader at the bottom:

* recognizes that employees are the front line of the business and gives them corresponding responsibilities and credit.
* hires people better than himself or herself to lead each value-add function.
* maintains a super high level of motivation and performance by providing objectives and feedback that make each person in the company the frontier of growth.
* recognizes that a job fit depends on the person, the function and the specific present objectives of the company. It is not personal, but sometimes certain employees need to go.
* acts as an internal champion who is not vested in any scared cows but rather only wants to help making better decisions. A leader fights for structure, not for a particular solution.

I personally have a hard time not jumping into every discussion and Leading from the bottom. I tend to micromanage at the slightest doubt that someone may not be on top of his or her game. It's a work in progress for me.

Make yourself the bottom of the organization.
