## The best that can happen

Founders are, at first, afraid of shipping fast and break things.

Soon they experience that speed is critical, and their thoughts frequently go to "What's the worst that could happen?".

Indeed, yes, there's little to lose by being bold. You rarely will lose a user by being bold (awesome) or fast (awesome).

But the problem is not the worst that can happen! The challenge is that you are in business to get amazing outcomes!

For "the best that could happen", you'll need more than vision or courage. You must amaze users, and that requires a lot of intent!

So, lesson one is to ship big crazy things, and fast. Lesson two is to ship them exactly as they need to be to revolutionize the world. And that requires you to plan "the best that could happen."
