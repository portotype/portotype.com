# problem 

- to operate a company in a country in the EU, you shouldn't need a local bank account. 
- however, certain operations only work as such. while Iban, direct debits (via IBAN) and card payments exist, there are many exceptions where you need a particular payment method that is de facto mandatory. 
- this barrs businesses from consolidating their banking operations.  

Example
- Portugal
    - payments to the state (VAT, Profit and other taxes, fines)
    - when paying monthly salaries, social security and income tax payments. 
    - payment for some services is exclusive to RefMB or . 
    - financial operations that require a "local IBAN" (real vida)
    - payment methods that are "standard"
        - "Pagamento ao Estado". Used for IRS retentions, profit, fines.   
        - "Referencia Multibanco". Used for many state and private actions.

# solution 

A terminal on the web where you can make any payment for any country. 


Potential clients 
- companies operating with multi-country accounts.
- remote.com: they operate many clients in different geographies, and probably need to open accounts as such.
