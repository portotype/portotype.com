# what it is

Have a payment portal on the web where you can pay for any bill of any country, with any payment method.

# problem 

- to operate a company in a country in the EU, you shouldn't need a local bank account. 
- however, in practice you do.
- certain operations only work as such. while iban, direct debits (via IBAN) and card payments exist, there are many exceptions where you need a particular payment method that is de facto mandatory. 
- this barrs businesses from consolidating their banking operations.  

Example
- Portugal
    - payments to the state (VAT, Profit and other taxes, fines)
    - when paying monthly salaries, social security and income tax payments. 
    - payment for some services is exclusive to RefMB or . 
    - financial operations that require a "local IBAN" (real vida)
    - payment methods that are "standard"
        - "Pagamento ao Estado". Used for IRS retentions, profit, fines.   
        - "Referencia Multibanco". Used for many state and private actions. 
- TBD
    - Spain
    - IT
    - FR
    
# solution 

A terminal on the web where you can make any payment for any country. 

Benefit: avoiding having to setup accounts, consolidate and manage cash between those countries accounts, with complex permissions, delays, and a lack of security.

# Business

Potential clients 
- companies operating with multi-country accounts.
- remote.com: they operate many clients in different geographies, and probably need to open accounts as such.

Evolution: automate payments, etc.
