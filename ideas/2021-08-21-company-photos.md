# Company Photo

# what is the idea

- to build a platform where teams can collect pictures of their colleagues.

# problem

- Teams need pictures of their members:
    - about pages of companies.
    - team org charts.
    - powerpoint presentations.
    - promotional material (e.g. women's day).
    - intranet.
- creating lists of pictures of teams is essential, but hard: slow, low-quality and expensive.
- today, there's 3 ways of taking team pictures:
    1. you gather everyone in one place to take a picture. 
    2. you get a photographer to take an individual picture of each team member. 
    3. you ask everyone to send an old picture they have and you adapt it. 
- this is a very modern need, and will become more so.
    - The world is going remote, and that means taking pictures is more important for people to know each other and to ensure culture consistency.
    - The world is mobile, instagram and tik-tok. Visuals matter.
    - The world is collaborative and dynamic, and teams change and reconfigure ever faster.

# solution

- our solution is to have a system that automatically collects custom, high-quality pictures:
- user
    1. the user goes to an app or web-page.
    2. the user adds his email as login, which gets confirmed.
    3. the user sees the picture(s) he is requested to take.
    4. the user gets a selfie photo on their phone camera, with a "guide"
        - the guide is a small circle over the camera image, indicating the size of the head, as a positioning element. Just like when opening a new bank account in revolut.
        - the company can ask for other positions: hands in the air, inclined against a wall, on the corner of a table.
        - the camera can check for colors, etc.
    5. the user presses send to send the picture. That's it.
- company 
    1. the company gets a list of pictures, already trimmed and treated.
    2. the company can define
        - which pictures and positions it's looking for. Example: standard, standing, on a table, mother's day, earth day, kids day, hands up in the air, looking up/down/left/right, funny look, with a hat.
        - times for the picture and general quality settings (light, background). 
    3. the company can access the pictures:
        - get an export for a powerpoint, pdf.
        - organize it in a org-chart in the tool.
        - access the pictures via a private API.
    4. Visual identity
        - Sync with Online services, like Google Suite, Outlook, Slack, Notion, Linkedin etc.
- community
    - you can collect pictures and badges of the companies and people you worked with.
    - you can grow this business into the verification layer; the image is the first step, and then you go into challenges & teams

# business model

- the company pays to access software.
