# What it is

An online book to register company resolutions, as required by law in Portugal (and elsewhere?).

# Why

- to have a company in portugal you need to have to keep a record of company resolutions by the shareholders and management, called Atas.
- You can register those individually or in a green book called "Livro de Atas".
- It's all a mess. The managers, lawyers and accountants need access to it for different purposes, and so the book moves left and right.
- Fundamentally, those are very simple page-by-page documents, with truncated lines, numbered pages, signatures. Each ata needs to be sequential (numbered) and dated.
- Tt is possible to have them as online versions, but there's not a good implementation.

# Business

Charge per page perhaps.
