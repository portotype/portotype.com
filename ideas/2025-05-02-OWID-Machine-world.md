# The Machine World

This idea is to create a new website that tracks numbers and data about the Machine World.

# why

In an increasingly complex world, there's more and more computers and software. 

But there isnt one large, public avenue where you can consume this data. 

- how many servers are there?
- what is the wattage of each?
- how many bots are there on social networks?
- how smart are the algorithms based on standard testing?
- which countries are more advanced and deploy the most machines and softwares?
- how many public software libraries are there ans what is our dependence of them?
- what are the rights of software holders and their responsibilities?
- how many algorithms are taking decisions about our life, in electric grids, etc?
- which data is ready to be consumed by machines in their decision process?
- whats our certainty that data is being published by machines unaltered? 

# precedence 

Our World in Data is a massive online publisher of Data on Humans, like Poverty, Health, Freedom.

We need the same for the machine world.

# structure

main object
- thinking machines (in general), the parallel to the person

properties to be studied
- computers (to be used by people; per type/ capability)
- computers (to be used by computers, like a DAC, switches of a network)
- electricity
- chips (category, generation)
- bandwidth (traffic; volume and types)
- cost
