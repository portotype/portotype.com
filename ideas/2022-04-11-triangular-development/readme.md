# What it is

A platform that leverages software development agencies and fractional CTOs/CPOs to deliver more value to clients. 

# problem

There seem to be too many agencies and too few engineers solving problems.  
- companies get constantly nagged by development agencies. those are local, from the same country, continent or global.
- companies need build more features, faster, at a reasonable cost.
- it's hard to commit to an agency given that you don't know people, you don't know if you can trust them, if it's going to work, etc.
- companies also don't want to manage another supplier.

# solution

- use the collaboration methods of open-source to provide turn-key verifiable solutions to IT requests.
- in particular, PRs/ git/ GitHub are uniquely positioned to establish a demo-first culture for PRs. "Show me the result and i'll pay for it".
- offer that on a platform where companies can write-up requests, offer limited access to their platform and where agencies can compete to deliver solutions.

# approach

- companies have to provide means for builds to be created and tested with the new code.
- the write-ups must be super clear.
- the platform takes a cut, and ultimately arbitrages the payment. the agreement is that both parties submit to the decision if need be.
- platform takes a 10-20% cut.
- fixed prices/ variable contracts.
- there's an incentive for contracts to become longer, and then for people to be pre-paid instead of post-paid as they accomplish more goals.
- create a trilateral position:
	- business owner
	- provider of build solution (code, PRs, design)
	- verifier/ maintainer of quality (can be BO or Provider or a third entity). Update: this is a fractional CTO/CPO of sorts.
