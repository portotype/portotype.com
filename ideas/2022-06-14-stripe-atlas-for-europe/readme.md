# what it is

Build a platform that declutters building companies in Europe.

# the problem

- it's hard and cumbersome to start a company in many places. the bureacratic side of it is required, but most of the stuff adds no real value to the average tech business. there's legal, accounting, invoicing, labor problems. 
- in europe it's especially hard. while many countries have an "instant company" program, knowing and dealing with requirements is hard.
- namely: the first shareholders agreement; issuance of stock; opening a bank account; doing a small raise; closing the company; filing yearly taxes; understanding duties etc; understanding Powers of representation/ attorney; understanding labor law/ employment contracts.

# solution

- a platform where you go to register and open a business in Germany, UK, PT, Estonia, etc. 
- the platform provides easy tracking of the status.
- it works through direct filing or POA. 
- it lets you open a company, issue stock, open a bank account, raise money, file annual duties, and execute business-as-usual deeds, such as hiring, promoting, invoices requirements.
- the platform provides up-to-date documents and ammendments to most common issues, especially labor contracts and required amendments, etc.
- it's a subscription.
- you can build it with one problem at a time, and then expand.
