- we live in a world of deepfakes.
- this is an iOS/ Android native app that takes a picture, and that guarantees that the picture is taken with the sensor, and at the GPS location is gotten from GPS sensor. (even though all sensors can be tricket by fake external stimuli).
- then a hash representation is sent to a server/crypto, where it becomes authenticated (time,place,pic).
- then you can offer a service that guarantees that a picture was taken by a real device, on a real time and place.
- the service should work even with crops and slight edits.
