# Understanding Investors

Some thoughts on investors collected from my experience and conversations with other founders.

On the positive side, most investors:

* Are very smart people and are connected to other smart people.
* Really want to see you succeed, wether or not they invested in you.
* Ask interesting questions when looking at your data.
* Have difficult schedules and travel a lot. That is hard work.
* Will give you plenty space to experiment.
* Are personally relatable and have cool interests. 
* Understand the need to rest and family time. 

On the negative side, beware that a majority of investors:

* Are very busy and spread too thin. They will forget what you tell them from meeting to meeting (sometimes within the meeting) and repeat questions a lot. 
* Are insecure. Investing is hard, signaling is strong, and most suffer a lot from "me too" dynamics.
* Are deal driven. Frequently, investors don't really understand or voice opinions on important tech trends. They want to get deals done.

A minority of outstanding investors:

* Always give more than they ask. They are active ambassadors, users, product team members, etc.
* Have unique, god-view insights into your product and users.
* Have great taste.
* Are opinionated and useful when benchmarking your business, qualitatively and quantitatively (like metrics). They'll tell you what doesn't need fixing, and what does.
