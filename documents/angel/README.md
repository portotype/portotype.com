How do I invest?
- I invest mostly in topics close to my interests: software that helps its users be the hero; generally that means work and productivity software, and in particular the more technically deeper the software, the more I like it. Exceptions to this are startups of people in my direct network who I know well, including some local heroes in Porto/ Portugal and in the Berlin ecosystem. 
- I have stock in startups via investments and agreements, sometimes both. Investments are situations where I directly invested money. I give cash, I get shares. I made my first investments as Humberto (the person) and I now make investments as via my micro investment company (Portotype). Agreements are situations where I have not directly investment money, and I get shares because of my involvement. Here, too, I followed the same evolution: I used to do agreements personally, and now I do them via my company Portotype. Agreements are of 3 types: Advisor, Scout and Others. Advisor agreements are those that reward me with shares for helping a company or being a Board Member; in these, conditions apply to these shares, including vesting, and I can be "let go" of them. Scouting agreements give me the economic benefit of shares for helping a VC fund find good investments; in particular, the companies that say "via Accel Starters" on my list are those where the Accel Starters scouting program invested for me; this means that I don't actually sign the investment or send them money; I just indicate the companies, and Accel invests. If the company is successful, and others in the scouting program are successful, I will get some of the return. Then there's other agreements and programs, where I gain some carry on investments through other mechanics.    
- For investments, the amounts I put in are $10k or less, with a couple of exceptions. These are small amounts for startups, and it means that I get very small stakes in the companies, typically 0.005%-1%. There's a few ways to get bigger stakes in a company: a) you know the founders well and they let you in very early, sometimes even before the company gets incorporated. b) You participate in a pre-seed/ seed round with very favorable terms for a first-time founder or riskier idea; c) you are going to be part of the journey as an advisor or as a Board Member, which typically means that you have an agreeement that entitles you to some additional stock.
