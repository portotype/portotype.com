# Be your own boss

I believe that everyone is special and that everyone wants to feel special. 

For many, that means building something for the world. Something with impact. 

Yet it's hard to start in a position of relevance. Many get impatient at their stepping-stone jobs. They want to be at the top to be able to implement their ideas. They want to be the boss. Fast.

I think anyone can get there faster by being their own boss.

* **A boss has objectives**. Ask your manager for your objectives, challenge them and push yourself. Always make yourself chase goals that make you slightly uncomfortable.
* **A boss has a budget**. Managing money is essential. Talk to your manager and ask for yours. How much money can you spend on your function? If it's not money, how many hours? How many people can you manage? How much inventory can you spend for your purposes? How much revenue is expected of you? Operate your day like it was a profit center, managing revenue and cost. The more you deliver value against an investment, the faster you will see recognition.
* **A boss closes the loop**. Don't create to-dos of things you won't follow through. Revisit your objectives, close them all and acknowledge the failures directly.
* **A boss doesn't complain**. Focus on the work at hand, what needs to be done and what tools you need. There's plenty of valid feedback, and incidents that should take priority. But some frustration is in my opinion unsolvable: companies are big, they have lots of people with lots of opinions, and you are unlikely to get exactly what you wish every time. Just assume the compromise, and focus on your tasks to be successful.      

If you are not on top of all aspects of your trade, someone else will have to be. And you'll miss out on the opportunity to grow.

Act like your area is your own mini-company. And don't miss out on details and fun.
