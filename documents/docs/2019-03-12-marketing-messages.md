# Marketing messages

It's easy to write a slogan, but its hard to write a great one.

To aid me in the initial exploration, I first decide what I want to communicate:
- The Product
- The Use Case
- The Brand

And also, the urgency that I want to imprint:
- solving a pain (aspirin)
- improving a situation (vitamin)
- a bare description of the facts (neutral). 

If we put that in a matrix, we get the following options.

| Area      | Aspirin                       | Vitamin                   | Neutral               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Product** | Product solves Situation.  | Product improves Situation. | How the Product Works. |
| **Use Case** | Use Case is solved. | Use Case is improved. | Use Case description.  |
| **Brand** | Aspirational Life post Situation.  | Aspirational life with improved Situation.  | Aspirational life.    |

An Example. Let's say I'm building a website with a system that helps companies find the best recruitment candidates. Here are the different ways I could talk about it.

| Area      | Aspirin                       | Vitamin                   | Neutral               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Product**   | The Linkedin bot that mines the best leads.  | A Linkedin bot that gets hiring leads that churn less. | A bot that mines Linkedin for leads that match your colleagues. |
| **Use Case**  | The best hiring leads from Linkedin. | Hiring leads that churn less. | Leads that match your colleagues.  |
| **Brand**     | Solving talent.  | The better HR fit.  | A company worth working for. |
